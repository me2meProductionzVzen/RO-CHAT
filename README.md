ROCHAT Is one of my projects that i am working on, it's intended purpouse is to be an ROBLOX exploit, the name is

very self explanatory, it listens to the chat if you, the localplayer has typed anything and will run commands if those
strings do exist, (must start with prefix!), this github only exists for loadstrings for stuff that are pretty big
to fit in the main script, so it wont be a really really big script.
